## First Steps

This is your first Quarto document for ANTH455D!

For this exercise, we'll use the **tidyverse** and **palmerpenguins** packages. Run the following code below (click the green button in the top right). Further, label the code chunk `load-packages` using `#| label`.

```{r}
#| include: false

library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)

```

## Uh-oh?

Did you get any error codes?

-   [x] **Task**: Copy/paste your error code here: \<!-Error in library(palmerpenguins) :

    there is no package called ‘palmerpenguins’undefined

If you haven't played around in R before, you might not have packages installed. Run the following code, noting that you have to put your packages in quotes for `install.packages`

```{r}
#| include: false
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("palmerpenguins") 

```

That installed the packages onto your computer so that R can access it. In order to use it in our current session, we have to load the package using the library() function.

-   [x] **Task**: Re-run the code chunk that loads libraries tidyverse and palmerpenguins, now that you've installed them.

## Meet Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Meet the penguins

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web/main/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio/lter_penguins.png){style="float:right;" fig-alt="Illustration of three species of Palmer Archipelago penguins: Chinstrap, Gentoo, and Adelie. Artwork by @allison_horst." width="401"}

The `penguins` data from the [**palmerpenguins**](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins "palmerpenguins R package") package contains size measurements for `{r} nrow(penguins)` penguins from three species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

The plot below shows the relationship between flipper and bill lengths of these penguins. We'll learn more about making a plot like this in later weeks.

```{r}
#| label: plot-penguins
#| warning: false
#| echo: false

ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(
    title = "Flipper and bill length",
    subtitle = "Dimensions for penguins at Palmer Station LTER",
    x = "Flipper length (mm)", y = "Bill length (mm)",
    color = "Penguin species", shape = "Penguin species"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Wait, penguins don't have much to do with anthropology?!

Good catch. When your instructor is just *struggling* for anthropology examples, you'll probably analyze some penguins instead.

### Okay, but can we please start this with some anthropological data?

*Fine.* Have a look in the files tab (if you haven't moved anything around in RStudio, it's the tab on the bottom right). See a file ending in .csv? Let's load it.

## Loading data

There's generally three ways to load data into R environment.

1.  Use a package to grab a dataset from online (like Palmer's Penguins).

2.  Using the Files tab, click on the dataset you want and then click 'Import Dataset...'

3.  Run some handy code.

-   [x] **Task**: Below, write one reason you'd use the 'Import Dataset...' button, and one reason you'd have some code to load data.

    One reason to use import dataset is that I am new to R and have never programmed before, so clicking through the interface is a more user-friendly way to load data. Using code, on the other hand, is better because it is faster and allows for reproducibility if someone copies and runs the code later.

I suggest you play with the Import Dataset button to bring in the dataset (there's some good reasons to use it), but there's also this handy code chunk:

```{r}
#| label: load dataframe
#| echo: false
df <- read.csv("pone.0233912.s002.csv")
```

**Note**: The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

## Examining Data

We'll talk more about types of data and ways to store data (generally and in R) next week, but you've just loaded a dataframe, a widely used data structure for storing and working with tabular data. I tend to name my dataframes "df", especially when I a) only have one dataframe and/or b) I'm just looking at stuff on the fly.

### Environment tab

In the square in the top right of your screen, check out the Environment tab. Do you see the dataframe df? Click the little blue and white circled arrow next to it, you'll now see 28 variables.

-   [ ] **Task:** Write a few (3-5) sentences about the types of data you see (just pick a few, no need to go crazy Week 1), and then a couple sentences about what you think this dataset is from. (Hint 1: I've left enough breadcrumbs that you can find the original publication.) (Hint 2: If you click on the dataframe in the top right pane, the dataframe will open as a table in this pane and you can more easily scroll about.)\

    The types of data I chose are artifact ID, size, type, material, and color. Artifact IDs are usually associated with unique identifiers that allow artifacts to be tracked across provenience records and databases. Size is important because it provides information about function and potential use, facilitates comparisons between artifacts, helps locate items within a collection, and informs storage and space requirements, among others. Type is important because it allows artifacts to be grouped into categories, facilitating site interpretation and the development of cultural inferences. Color is important because it can provide information about the original material used; for example, in the case of lithic flakes, color may help identify the type of chert or stone source.

    Judging by the categories I chose, the data appear to come from lithic materials, with data types related to flakes and cores. These types of materials are usually associated with Native American sites and are linked to activities such as raw material extraction and on-site tool production.\

-   [ ] Change the title and author of this document to a title that makes sense to you and your name as author. Submit these Quarto files via GitHub and/or D2L. In my ideal world, you push to Github and then just paste the link in the assignment tab on D2L- let's me find your GitHub quickly, and it saves you from D2L "reminding" you that you haven't done the assignment.
